title: Deletion confirmation
question: Have you regretted answering “Really delete this?” with yes?
authors: Johannes Maas
---

"Are you sure?" Yes, of course. I rarely click the delete button by accident. Instead, I'm now used to just always clicking yes as a part of all my deletions.

But sometimes I then notice that I deleted the wrong thing. Great. So now the confirmation makes deleting take longer, but still does not prevent me from accidental deletion. `This issue is described in [Don Norman]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman}'s book [The Design of Everyday Things]{link|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things} (ISBN 978-0-465-05065-9, pp. 203--204).`{note}

    How to fix it

Do not ask for confirmation. Offer undo.

Some services already do this. After deletion, they typically show a little box with an undo button for a short while. Deleting this way is quick and easy, and if I delete something by accident, no worries, I restore it immediately.
